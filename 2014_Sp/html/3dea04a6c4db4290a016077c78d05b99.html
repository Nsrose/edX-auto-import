<h1>Experiencing Algorithms</h1>
<p>We're going to step away from the computer for some activities that your teacher will lead.</p>
<ol>
	<li>You'll use numbered cups to explore different ways to search for a number in a list of numbers.</li>
	<li>You'll think about ways to speed up this process.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind the following questions while you are working on this activity:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		What strategies exist for finding a particular number in the fewest number of location checks?
	</li>
	<li>
		How many guesses would it take on average to find a number?
	</li>
	<li>
		How many guesses would it take to determine that a number didnâ€™t exist in the list at all?
	</li>
	<li>
		How much additional work will it be to find a number if N, the highest numbered cup, were to increase?
	</li>
</ul>
