<h2>Exponential-Time Algorithms - O(2<sup>n</sup>
)</h2>
<p>An exponential-time algorithm is one that takes time 
  proportional to 2<sup>n</sup>
.  In other words, if the size of the input 
increases by one, the number of steps doubles.  Note that 
logarithms and exponents are inverses of each 
other.  Algorithms in this category are often considered too 
slow to be practical, especially if the input is typically 
large.   <br /> <br />Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a number n, generate a list of every n-bit binary 
number</li>

</ul>
