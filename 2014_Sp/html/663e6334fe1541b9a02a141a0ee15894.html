<h1>Sum-thing's Up</h1>
<p>Now let's consider a slightly more complicated block that makes use of a loop. It accepts two numbers as inputs (start and end) and finds the sum of all of the numbers in the range from start to end, inclusive.</p>

<p>

  When start = 8 and end = 10, the value reported by this function will be 27 (8+9+10). How do you think you'd make this block? Try building it and see if you can make it work.</p>
