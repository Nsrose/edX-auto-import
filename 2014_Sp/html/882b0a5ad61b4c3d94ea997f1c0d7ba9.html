<h2>Cubic-Time Algorithms - O(n<sup>3</sup>)</h2>
<p>A cubic-time algorithm is one that takes a number of steps proportional to n<sup>3</sup> . &nbsp;In other words, if the input doubles, the number of steps is multiplied by 8. &nbsp;Similarly to the quadratic case, this could be the result of applying an n<sup>2</sup> algorithm to n items, or applying a linear algorithm to n<sup>2</sup> items.. <br /> <br />Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fill in a 3D board (or environment)</li>
<li>For each object in a list, construct an n-by-n bitmap drawing of the object</li>
</ul>
