<h3>Bytes</h3>
<p>Bits can be represented in packages called bytes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Byte = 8 bits</li>
<li>Kilobyte = 1024 or 2^10 bytes, 10^3 bytes</li>
<li>Megabyte = 10^6 bytes</li>
<li>Gigabyte = 10^9 bytes</li>
<li>Terabyte = 10^12</li>
<li>Petabyte = 10^15</li>
<li>Exabyte = 10^18</li>
<li>Zettabyte = 10^21</li>
<li>Yottabyte = 10^24</li>
<li>Hellabyte = 10^27</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://pixelbits.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/petition-to-make-10-27th-power-called-hellabytes-word/">Hellabyte?</a> Yes indeed. Google it.</p>
<h3>How is data stored in bytes?</h3>
<p>According to Facebook: "We store more than 100 petabytes (100 quadrillion bytes) of photos and videos." (<a>Source</a>)</p>
<p>This includes a lot of videos, but it's still a staggering amount of data. videos. 100 petabytes is equal to 100,000 terabytes, or if you want to break it down even smaller, 100 million gigabytes. That's a lot of bytes.</p>

<h3> ASCII: How are letters represented by computers?</h3>
The letters of the alphabet have been mapped to specific binary numbers so they can be represented by computers. For example:
<ul>
  <li>A = 65, or 0010 0001</li>
  <li>B = 66, or 0010 0010</li>
  <li>C = 67, or 0010 0011</li>
    </ul>

<p> So spelling CAB would be a total of 24 bits. You can look up the bits for the rest of the alphabet in an <a href="http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_ideas/CompSci_ASCII_Table.shtml">ASCII table</a>. How many bits would a 750 word paper have? Assume you have an average of 5 letters per word and ignore spaces:</p>
<p> 5 (letters per word) x 8 (bits per letter) x 750 (words) = 30,000 bits = 3,750 bytes = 3.7KB</p>

<h3>"NO"</h3>
<p>Recall the Big Bang video clip? Let's figure out how to say "NO" in binary!
<br><br>
Look up the ASCII table in the link above or search for one yourself. For simplicity, use only capital letters.
<ul>
  <li>What is the binary string for "N"? 0100 1110</li>
  <li>What is the binary string for "O"? 0100 1111</li>
  </ul> 
  Now just put it together: 0100111001001111
