  <div style="text-align: left;">Now that you have some experience with some recursion, we're going to point out some of the anatomy of a recursive procedure. The line numbers mentioned below refer to the picture at the end of this page.<br><ul>

      <li>We always need a way to figure out that we're done and shouldn't call the recursive call again. Lines 2-4 are the <em>Base Case,</em> in which we handle a situation so simple that we don't need to call the block recursively.</li>

      <li>If this isn't the base case we think to ourselves "Woah &#8212; That seems complicated. I'll just do a small part of the problem and delegate to someone else". Here's what we do:<br></li>

      <ul><li>draw the trunk of the tree (line 6), <br></li>

        <li>position the sprite for the left sub-tree (line 7), <br></li>

        <li>delegate to another copy of the tree block the drawing of the left sub-tree (line 8), </li>

        <li>re-position the sprite for the right sub-tree (line 9),</li>

        <li>delegate to another copy of the tree block the drawing of the right sub-tree (line 10),</li>

        <li>re-position the sprite to retrace the trunk (line 11), and<br></li>

        <li>retrace the trunk and leave the sprite exactly where it started out.
