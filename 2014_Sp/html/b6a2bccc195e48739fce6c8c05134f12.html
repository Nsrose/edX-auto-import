<h1>Linear Time</h1>
<p>You may have noticed that if you increased max by a factor of two, then the computer took approximately twice as much time to fill the numbers list. Similarly, if you increased max by a factor of ten, then the computer took approximately ten times as much time; if you increased max by a factor of 100, then the computer ran approximately 100 times longer. In general, as we scale the size of the input by a certain amount, we also scale the running time by the same amount. We call these algorithms <strong>linear-time</strong> algorithms, because if we were to plot the runtime of one such algorithm against the size of its input, we would get a line.</p>
<p>Why is the algorithm a linear-time algorithm? When max was set to 20, we had to add 20 numbers to the numberslist; when max was set to 40, we had to add 40 numbers to the number list. In other words, as we scaled max, we also scaled how many numbers we had to add to the numbers list by the same amount. Linear-time algorithms are also much sought-after in computer science, and for many problems, they are the fastest algorithms you can find.</p>
