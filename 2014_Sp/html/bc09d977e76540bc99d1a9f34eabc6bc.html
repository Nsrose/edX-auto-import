<h1>All the Numbers, All the Time</h1>
<p>For this section, we will be using <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs10/labs/prog/BYOB/timing.ypr">this timing framework</a>. It is very similar to the framework you constructed earlier, but it also has the stubs for a few blocks that we will be filling in. The first block that we will fill in is already on stage:
		</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img title="Insert all numbers between 'start' and 'end' into 'list'" alt="Insert all numbers between 'start' and 'end' into 'list'" src="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs10/labs/img/list/insert-all-numbers-block.png" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab08/Complexity/InsertAllNumbers.jpg">
        </div>
<p>This block should fill the input list with all of the numbers from <tt>start</tt> to <tt>end</tt>. If working correctly, the version used on stage should generate all of the numbers from <tt>1</tt> to <tt>max</tt>, where <tt>max</tt> is a number that we will change when running timing experiments, and should add them to the <tt>numbers</tt> list.
        </p>
<p>First, talk to your partner and discuss an algorithm that you can use to fill the input list with all of the numbers from <tt>start</tt> to <tt>end</tt>. Once you both have decided on an algorithm, complete the body of the block. Now, run the script with <tt>max</tt> set to <tt>10</tt>. Run it a few times to get an idea of the average time the computer takes to generate this list (to the nearest tenth of a second); you don't need to be exact! Repeat the experiment with <tt>max</tt> set to <tt>20</tt>, <tt>40</tt>, <tt>100</tt>, <tt>200</tt>, and <tt>1000</tt>. Do you see a pattern?
