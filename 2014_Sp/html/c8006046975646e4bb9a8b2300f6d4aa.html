<h1>Make A Draw Polygon Block</h1>
<p>
    Now, you are going to make a block that takes two inputs.  We want to create a 
    <tt>
      draw polygon
    </tt>
     block that takes a number of sides and  the length of each side as its inputs.  We will call these inputs 
    <tt>
        sides
    </tt>
     and 
    <tt>
        length
    </tt>
    .  This exercise should be done with a partner, so introduce yourself to your neighbor and get started on the exercise together.

        this lesson
    </a>
     how to draw a regular polygon. How many degrees altogether? How many turns?
