<h1>Position on the Stage</h1>
<p>The sprite occupies a position (x,y) on the stage where x represents the horizontal position, from -240 (left) to 240 (right), and y represents the vertical position, from -180 (bottom) to 180 (top). Here's a picture:</p>
<p><img title="X and Y Axis on Stage" alt="X and Y Axis on Stage" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/sys/axes.png" /></p>
<p>The black sprite is at the center of the stage, called the <em>origin, </em>with coordinates (0, 0). The green sprite is to the right of the origin, so its x position is positive; it's below the origin, so its y position is negative. Each grid line above represents 20 steps, so the green sprite's coordinates are (140, -100). Take some time to make sure you understand this, discussing it with your partner or classmate.</p>
