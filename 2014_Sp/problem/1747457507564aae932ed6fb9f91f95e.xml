    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>The second choice will always return 0, since we are not calculating the sum, but instead just giving a new input to the function. For example, if our input is 3, this is what our calls would look like:</p>
      <p>-&gt; 3 is not 0, call function with input 3-1 = 2</p>
      <p>-&gt; 2 is not 0, call function with input 2-1 = 1</p>
      <p>-&gt; 1 is not 0, call function with input 1-1 = 0</p>
      <p>-&gt; 0 is equal to 0, report 0</p>
