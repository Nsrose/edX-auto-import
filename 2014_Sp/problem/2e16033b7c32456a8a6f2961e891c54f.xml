  <solution>
    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Polygons that don't intersect themselves require a total turning of 360 degrees â€” one full circle. Stars turn all the way around more than once. Try using something like a pencil (flat on the table) to simulate a sprite tracing the path of a star.</p>
