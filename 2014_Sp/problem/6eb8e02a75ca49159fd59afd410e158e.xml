      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>a. You've seen this already ... it's called MapReduce. TRUE!</p>
      <p>b. is false ... iOS devices are programmed in ObjectiveC, not Java.</p>
      <p>c. is false ... search algorithms certainly do use floating point numbers to find similarities of your query with the results they've cached.</p>
      <p>d. is false ... it's mostly done using cluster computing (with GPUs more and more), not exotic vector supercomputer hardware.</p>
