      <choice correct="true">An algorithm that reports the winning moves for a tic tac toe game.</choice>
      <choice correct="false">An algorithm that reports the sum of a finite list of numbers.</choice>
      <choice correct="true">An algorithm that reports the winning moves to win a pacman game.</choice>

  <solution>
    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>The algorithms 1 and 3 will only report the winning move if there is a winning move in each state of the game. Therefore, they are 'partially correct', because they sometimes report, but when they do, what they report is correct. The second choice will report the correct answer everytime, for any list of numbers.</p>
