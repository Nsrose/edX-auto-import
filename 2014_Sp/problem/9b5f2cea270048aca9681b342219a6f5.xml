  <solution>
    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p><b>Domain:</b> Our domain can be either the list of student names or the list of student ID's since both will have the same length, since they are both dependent on the number of students in the class.</p>
      <p><b>Range:</b> Since the function finds the total number of students in a class, we want to return a single number.</p>
