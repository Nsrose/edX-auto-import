  <p>Consider the example just demonstrated by Dan. Instead of the dataflow of "keep-&gt;map-&gt;combine", we reordered the first two to yield "map-&gt;keep-&gt;combine". With the input of "University of California at Berkeley", what would be the output?</p>

  <solution>
    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>If we map first, we get (U o C a B) as a list, but then we filter out the following words: "a an the for of in at to", which means we filter out the "a" leaving (U o C B), and when we smush them together using combine, we get "UoCB". Not what we want, but close.</p>
