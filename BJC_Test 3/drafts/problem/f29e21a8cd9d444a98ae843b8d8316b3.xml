<problem markdown="&#9;&#10;&#10;Without trying this in snap, try to answer the following question:&#10;&#10;What does the following set of scripts do when the Turn1 message is broadcast? &#10;     ( ) The sprite says &quot;Go!&quot; and then &quot;Team!&quot; and then stops.&#10;     ( ) Nothing happens - the script does not work.&#10;     (x) The sprite repeatedly says &quot;Go!&quot; and then &quot;Team!&quot; until you hit the red Stop button.&#10;     ( ) The sprite says &quot;Go!&quot; and then &quot;Team!&quot;, repeating a few times, and then stops by itself. &#10;&#9;&#10;     &#10;[explanation]&#10;Right! Here, we see an infinite loop, or a never-ending loop. Whenever this happens in Snap!, we can always stop it by pressing the Stop button at the top right of the window, just above the stage.&#10;&#10;Why does this happen? Well, when you the Turn1 message is first broadcast, the sprite says Go! for half a second, and then broadcasts a Turn2 message.&#10;&#10;If there is any character that has a script that responds to the Turn2 message, it will perform that script. In this case, the same sprite has a script that responds to the Turn2 message, and so it will run the corresponding script. It says Team! and then broadcasts a Turn1 message. But, it also has a script that responds to the Turn1 message, which in turn sends a Turn2 message, and so on. This continues until the scripts are forced to stop.&#10;[explanation]&#10;" display_name="Test Yourself: Go Team!" showanswer="answered">
