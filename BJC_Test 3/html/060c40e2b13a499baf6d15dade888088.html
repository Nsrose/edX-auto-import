<p> First, to understand the idea of two things happening at once, open
this Snap! file <code><a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:http://www.corsproxy.com/inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs10/labs/prog/Snap/LaunchTutorial.xml">LaunchTutorial</a></code>
(shown above). After you click the green flag, let it run for a bit,
then hit the space bar once. Then hit it again, and again. Talk with
your partner about what is happening, and why. </p>
<p> (Answer: When you hit the green flag, the sprite starts off running
in a
circle, because it is moving and turning at the same time. Now,
whenever
you hit the space key the sprite's circles become wider because it is
moving <em>more</em>
than before, and it only does that because its MOVE <em>threads</em>
are increasing, not the number of steps per single move. For example,
Snap!
initially gives equal time to its 2 "forever" children -- one that
turns and one that moves 5 steps. So it is move, turn, move, turn,
etc.,
yielding a (360/15 =) 24-sided polygon with 5-step sides. The next time
space bar is pressed, another "child" is born, so now the three
equal-time children are: "turn", "move" and "move", yielding a 24-sided
polygon with 10-step sides, or a "circle" of twice the size) </p>
