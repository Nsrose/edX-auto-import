This one is a little harder because you have to write both the 

mapper and reducer. The idea is you've got a huge set of data and you need to keep only the ones that match. 

Fill in the body for the <img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/hof/mapper-block.gif" alt="mapper" origsrc="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/mapper.gif"> and <img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/sys/reducer-block.gif" alt="reducer" origsrc="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/reducer.gif"> for the <code> Love</code> sprite and test it.</p>

       <td align="center">Same form as the input: a list of song titles, except each one has the word "love" in it.</td>
