<h2>Linear-Time Algorithms - O(n)</h2>
<p>A linear-time algorithm is one that takes a number of steps 
directly proportional to the size of the input. Â In other words, 
if the size of the input doubles, the number of steps 
doubles. &nbsp;
  <br>
  <br>Here are some examples:
  <ul>
 
<li>Given a list of words, say each item of a list</li>
<li>Given a list of numbers, add each pair of numbers together 
(item 1 + item 2, item 3 + item 4, etc.)
</li>
  <li>Given a list of numbers, multiply every 3rd number by 2 </li>
  
  <br><h4>Consider this:</h4> Why is the last example still linear time?
  </ul>
