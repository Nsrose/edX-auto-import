<p> When lots of broadcasts are coming through into a receive block, there are three possibilities: </p>

<ol>
  <li>If you want <em>all</em> of them to take effect, use "<code>broadcast
_ and wait</code>"</li>
  <li>If you do not need all of them to take effect, but want to keep
all of your inner data structures consistent, make sure you have <code>Edit-&gt;Thread
Safe Scripts</code> checked.</li>

    
  <li>If you have Edit-&gt;Thread Safe Scripts unchecked, you cannot
trust Snap! to preserve your Loop Invariants!</li>

    
  <li>Lesson: The first thing you should always do is check <code>Edit-&gt;Thread
Safe Scripts</code>! </li>
