<h1>Blocks and Scripts</h1>
<p>Snap<em>!</em>&nbsp;is a programming language -&mdash; a notation in which you can tell a computer what you want it to do.&nbsp; Unlike most programming languages, though, Snap<em>!</em>&nbsp;is a <em>visual </em>language; instead of writing a program using the keyboard, the Snap<em>!</em> &nbsp;programmer uses the same drag-and-drop interface familiar to computer users.</p>
<p>Start Snap<em>!</em>. You should see the following arrangement of regions&nbsp;in the window:</p>
<img alt="Snap palette, scripting area, stage, etc" width="80%" style="center" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/sys/snapwindow.png">
<p>(The proportions of these areas may be different, depending on the size and shape of your browser window.)  
</p>
<p>A Snap<em>!</em> program consists of one or more <em>scripts,</em> each of which is made of <em>blocks.</em>  Hereâ€™s a typical script:
</p>
<p><img alt="when flag, pen down, repeat 4, move turn" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/prog/script.png">
</p>
<p>The five blocks that make up this script have three different colors, corresponding to three of the eight palettes in which blocks can be found.  The palette area at the left edge of the window shows one palette at a time, chosen with the eight buttons just above the palette area.  In this script, the gold blocks are from the Control palette; the green block is from the Pen palette; and the blue blocks are from the Motion palette.  A script is assembled by dragging blocks from a palette into the scripting area in the middle part of the window.  Blocks snap together (hence the name Snap<em>!</em> for the language) when you drag a block so that its indentation is near the tab of the one above it:

</p>
<p>The white horizontal line is a signal that if you let go of the green block it will snap into the gold one.
</p>
<p>If you haven't already done so, make the script in the picture above, then find and click the green flag and see what happens.
