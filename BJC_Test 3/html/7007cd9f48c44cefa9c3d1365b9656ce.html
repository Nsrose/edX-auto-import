<h1>Experiment with Drawing Commands</h1>
</div>
<p>Try to get comfortable with the pieces shown below. Figure out what each one does and try to use these pieces to draw a square or a simple picture. <br /> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 200px;"><img title="Move Pieces Image" alt="Move Pieces Image" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/prog/prog-move-turn-clear-pen-down-blocks-BYOB.gif" /> </div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Note <br />
<ul>
<li>Once the pen is down, it stays down, even in a different script, until you say <code>pen up</code>.</li>
<li>It's easiest if your sprite wears the turtle costume (the arrowhead) so you can see the direction in which it's facing very clearly. </li>
<li>You also will want to show the direction and x and y position of the character. In the Motion tab you can select for these to be shown on the stage (like below). </li>
</ul>
<strong style="line-height: 1.6;">Try it</strong><span style="line-height: 1.6;"> - Does the turn command change the x or y position?&nbsp;</span></div>
