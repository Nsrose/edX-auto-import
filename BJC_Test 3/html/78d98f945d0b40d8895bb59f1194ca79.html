		<ul>

			<li>

				Add a third character. After the duck and the cat pick their choice and say it, the third character should say who wins. You may find <a href="http://bjc.eecs.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/prog/RPS.pdf" target="new">this chart</a> useful.

			</li>

			<li>

				Add <tt>cat score</tt> and <tt>duck score</tt> variables that keep track of how many times each character has won. You can make these variables visible on the stage by clicking on the check-box next to the variable name.
