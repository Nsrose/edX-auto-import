<h1>Experiment with a short Snap! play</h1>
<p>The <code>play sound </code> blocks in the short script examples from the last page played in order: one block and then the next until there are no more blocks to run. But we did see that what we actually heard depended on whether we waited until one sound was done playing before starting the next or not. (So what use is the non-<code>until done</code> version of the<code> play sound </code>block? If different sprites play different sounds at once, you can hear them both overlapping.)<code> <br /> </code></p>
<p>The <code>broadcast</code> block allows us to control which block is run next. Try to make these scripts in <span class="snap">snap</span>.</p>

<li>You can make a new project by clicking on <img alt="Snap file menu button" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/sys/button-file-menu.png" /> in the <span class="snap">snap</span> tool bar, at the top of the window.</li>
<li>You'll need to add a sprite to your project: use <img alt="Snap new sprite button" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/sys/button-new-sprite.png" /> between the stage and the sprite corral, at the center right of the window.</li>
<li>Each sprite will have separate costumes and scripting areas: click on the image in the sprite corral to focus on it. To add costumes, you just need to drag an image from a page in your browser over to the scripting area of your snap window. Here are costumes you can use:
<div class="center"><img alt="Alonzo sprite costume" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/costumes/alonzo.gif" /> <img alt="Duck sprite costume" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/costumes/duck1.png" /></div>
</li>
<li>Each sprite will have different scripts. To switch between the scripts and costumes for a sprite, use the tabs at the top of the scripting area.</li>
<li>Once you are done, press <img alt="Snap green flag button" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/sys/button-green-flag.png" /> to start the short play.</li>
</ul>
