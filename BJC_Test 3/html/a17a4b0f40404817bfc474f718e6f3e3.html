<h3> Now let's check out Base 2</h3>
<p> Notice how the numbers we multiply each power of 10 (10^x) when breaking down a number with scientific notation will only range from 0 to 9. Two major differences between base 10 numbering and base 2 are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Instead of multiplying by 10^x, we multiply by 2^x.</li>
  <li> Instead of ranging from 0 to 9, we range from 0 to 1.</li>
  
  <p> So instead of representing numbers with powers of 10 (1's, 10's, 100's, and 1000's), we represent them with powers of 2 (1', 2's, 4's, and 8's). For example, 1101 represents 1 x 2^3 (8) + 1 x 2^2 (4) + 0 x 2^1 (0) + 1 x 2^0 (1) = 13.</p>
  
  <h3>How can we count with binary?</h3>
<p> Consider 1011 (base 2), which equals 11 (base 10). So what if we want to add one to get 12? </p>
<p>Well it's the same as with base 10: If we have 9 in the one's place, it rolls over to add one by moving 1 to the 10's place. For 1011 (base 2), we have 1 in the 2^0 place, so we roll it over to the next open space to get 1100, or 12!</p>
