<h1>Competing with Young Gauss</h1>
<p>We would like to add all the numbers from 1 to N. One way we can do this is to manually add them, one by one.</p>
<p>We can, however, also follow in the footsteps of the young Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss, a now-revered 18th century mathematician. As the (possibly apocryphal) story goes, he was punished by his elementary school teacher to do the same exercise: add all the numbers from 1 to 100. The teacher, J. G. B&uuml;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">ttner, assumed that the problem would take Gauss a long time to do, yet Gauss finished the problem in a matter of seconds. He realized that, adding 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100 was the same as adding (1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + (3 + 98) + ... + (50 + 51). Each pair summed up to 101, and there were 50 of these pairs, so he quickly deduced that the answer was 101 x 50 = 5050.</span></p>
<p>In general, if you wanted to add the numbers from 1 to N, the answer would be (N + 1) * (N/2), because there are (N/2) pairs, each of which add up to (N + 1).</p>
<p>Imagine that you were playing a game against young Gauss to see who could add numbers from 1 to N faster: he does it his way, while you manually add them one by one. You can either win, lose, or tie in this game. What do you think would happen if N were 2? If N were 10? If N were 100? If N were a million?</p>
