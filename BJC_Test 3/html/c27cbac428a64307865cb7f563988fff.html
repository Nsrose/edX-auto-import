<h2>Quadratic-Time Algorithms - O(n<sup>2</sup>)
</h2>
<p>
  A quadratic-time algorithm is one that takes a number of steps proportional to n<sup>2</sup>. That is, if the size of the input doubles, the number fo steps quadruples. A typical pattern of quadratic-time algorithms is performing a linear-time operation on each item of the input (n steps per item * n items = n<sup>2</sup> steps).

  <br>Here are some examples:
  <ul>
 
<li>Compare each item of a list against all the other items in 
the list</li>
<li>Fill in a n-by-n game board
</li>
  
  </ul>
