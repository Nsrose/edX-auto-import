<h1>Building the Program</h1>
  
  <p>We're going to go through the program structure <em>bottom-up,</em> which means that you'll build helper blocks before you build <code>ttt</code> itself. But keep the goal in mind. We're not, right now, dealing with the user interface part of the game: displaying the board, accepting a move from the user, or even noticing when someone wins. Those parts will be easy to add once you've done the hard part, which is figuring out the computer's strategy.</p>

<h1>How do <em>you</em> play tic-tac-toe?</h1>
<p>Almost certainly, you have a bunch of rules of the form "<strong>if</strong> such-and-such is true, <strong>then</strong> play here." These rules have different degrees of urgency. For example, the most important rule is "if I can win on this move, then play in the winning square."</p>
<p>Before you read further, answer these questions, discussing them with your partner and with other students if necessary:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. What's the next most important rule?</p>
  <p>2. Can you express "If I can win on this move" in more detail, in terms of the current board position, so that you could program it into Snap!?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The if-all-else-fails rule is "If no other rule applies, play in the best possible square: the center (square 5), if it's free, or a corner (squares 1, 3, 7, and 9) as second choice, or an edge (2, 4, 6, 8) as last resort."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3. Why is the center the best choice? Why is a corner second best? You should have a really short, logical, convincing explanation. Compare your explanation with those of other students.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These three rules (including the one you answered in question 1 above) are part of everyone's tic-tac-toe strategy, and they are the minimum acceptable strategy for this assignment.  Humans don't always think alike about the in-between rules; we'll make suggestions later, after you finish the minimal assignment.</p>
