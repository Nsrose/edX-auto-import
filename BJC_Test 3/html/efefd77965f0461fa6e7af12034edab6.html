<p>To get started, load up our finished project, <a style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;" href="/bjc-r/prog/BYOB/MapReduce.ypr"><code><strong>MapReduce.ypr</strong></code></a>. Your screen should look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Startup splash Screen for MapReduce BYOB project" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/hof/map-reduce-berkeley-image-screen.png" /></p>
<p>Now, click the green flag to get started and initialize the system. After that, you can type any number 1-5 to run one of the five MapReduces below, and '<code>r</code>' to reset to the initial state. We've given you all the answers, so you can see and understand what the problem is asking you to do and what the expected output is.</p>
<p>By the way, the word <em>Domain</em> means 'input', and the word <em>Range</em> means 'output'.</p>
