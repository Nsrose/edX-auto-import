Snap! also allows us to do the converse: to report how long a program takes to finish. In the <tt>Sensing</tt> menu, you will see a command called <tt>reset timer</tt> and a reporter called <tt>timer</tt>: <br><br></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img style="width: 88px; height: 46px;" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/lab-8/reset-timer.JPG" alt="Reset Timer Command" title="Reset Timer Command" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab08/Complexity/ResetTimer.jpg"></div> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activate (tick-mark) the <tt>timer</tt> reporter and you should see a timer ticking away in the top left corner.&nbsp; It's been ticking ever since you opened up Snap!, and counts in tenths of a second:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img style="width: 480px; height: 360px;" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/lab-8/timer-ticking-on-stage-snap.png" alt="Timer ticking away" title="Timer ticking away" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab08/Complexity/TimerTicking.jpg"></div> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to be performing timing experiments in the following sections, so this timer will prove useful.&nbsp; Add the following timing framework script into the space for Snap! scripts:<br> <br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img style="width: 148px; height: 103px;" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/lab-8/timing-framework.png" alt="Timing Framework" title="Timing Framework" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab08/Complexity/TimingFramework.jpg"></div> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The script will reset the timer whenever the green flag is pressed. The sprite will then say <tt>Hello!</tt> for 1 second, and soon after that, the sprite will say the current time, less 1 second to account for how long the sprite said <tt>Hello!</tt>.&nbsp; If we replace <tt>Hello!</tt> with a reporter, then the sprite will say the answer of the reporter, and one second later, how long the reporter took to generate the answer: this is the timing information that we need.&nbsp; Save the script with the name <tt>TimingFramework</tt>.   </body></html>
