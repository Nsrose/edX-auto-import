Remember the game you played with young Gauss at the beginning of lab? We will implement the game in Snap!. </p> <p> <a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/loops/sum-things-up.html">Earlier in the lab</a>, you made a block that returned the sum of numbers between <tt>1</tt> and <tt>max</tt>. In the <tt>Variables</tt> menu, you will see two blocks: </p> <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img style="width: 241px; height: 61px;" alt="add all numbers in list" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/list/add-numbers-to-list-blocks.png" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab08/Complexity/AddBlocks.gif"> </div> <p> The first block sums up the numbers in the <tt>numbers</tt> list the normal, "non-Gauss" way: walking through the list and adding the numbers one by one. The second block sums up the numbers the "Gauss" way: using the formula <tt>(N + 1) * N/2</tt>, where, in this case, <tt>N</tt> is the same as <tt>max</tt>. (<a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/algorithms/competing-with-young-gauss.html">How did we get this formula?</a>) Complete the bodies of these blocks. </p> <p> Once you are done, drag the first block (the "non-Gauss" block) onto the stage and place it immediately after the <tt>add all numbers between 1 and max</tt> block. Also, move the <tt>reset timer</tt> block <em>after</em> the <tt>add all numbers between 1 and max</tt> block, since we only need to time how long the "non-Gauss" block takes to sum the numbers in the <tt>numbers</tt> list. </p> <p> Now, run the script with <tt>max</tt> set to <tt>10</tt>. Again, run it a few times to get an idea of the average time the computer takes to sum the numbers up. Repeat the experiment with <tt>max</tt> set to <tt>20</tt>, <tt>40</tt>, <tt>100</tt>, and <tt>1000</tt>. Based on your observations, what kind of runtime does the "non-Gauss" block have: constant, linear, or neither? Why do you think this is the case? </p> <p> Replace the "non-Gauss" block with the "Gauss" block. Once more, run the script with <tt>max</tt> set to <tt>10</tt>. Again, run it a few times to get an idea of the average time the computer takes to sum the numbers up. Repeat the experiment with <tt>max</tt> set to <tt>20</tt>, <tt>40</tt>, <tt>100</tt>, and <tt>1000</tt>. Based on your observations, what kind of runtime does the "Gauss" block have: constant, linear, or neither? Why do you think this is the case? </p> </body></html>
