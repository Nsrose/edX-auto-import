      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>The following will be based on the example of choosing a cooking recipe.</p>
      <p><b>Length/Time:</b> Assume you are tyring to boil an egg. This should be a simple fast task. So you wouldn't want an algorithm/recipe that would take 24hours to boil an egg.</p>
      <p><b>Efficiency:</b> Assume you are trying to bake a cake. A recipe tha gives you tips on how to make the cake more moist or nice smelling is preferred to one than just names the products to combine.</p>
      <p><b>Side Effects:</b> Assume you are trying to bake potatoes. You want to make sure that the recipe you follow does not involve a risk of lighting the kitchen on fire for example.</p>
