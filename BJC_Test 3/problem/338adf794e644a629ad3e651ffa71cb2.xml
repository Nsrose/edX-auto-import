  <solution>
    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>The sentence to list block takes it's word in our sentence and makes it an item of a list. In our case, we would get a list as so: [Build, Your, Own, Blocks]. Then the second item of that list is called, so the compose function returns 'Your'.</p>
