      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Since Avatar was done as "a batch process" (i.e,. a calculation not done in real-time), we could still produce it, but it would just take a lot longer to render. We would never be able to get close to the real-time photorealism that Gran Turismo has achieved, we need today's computers with their blistering-fast graphics cards for rendering, disk speed and capacity to store and retrieve the assets, and powerful CPUs to calculate the correct physics, motion, etc. It's not even close, that's why video games back in the eighties looked like they did!</p>
      <p>NB: The reason Avatar-like photo-realistic films weren't made back then wasn't because computers weren't powerful-enough (although that's partially to blame), it was because the algorithms to make things look photoreal weren't invented yet! Our understanding of how natural elements (hair, cloth, clouds, leaves, etc) look and move has really advanced since then!</p>
