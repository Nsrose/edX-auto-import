    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, none of these are true!</p>
      <p>a. is false because Moore's Law says that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles every 18 months.</p>
      <p>b. is false because Moore's Law is going strong, and those transistors are being used for multi-core processors and on-core memory.</p>
      <p>c. is false because you don't even know about the amazing applications you don't have yet that require incredible performance to succeed -- like speech recognition, augmented reality, etc.</p>
