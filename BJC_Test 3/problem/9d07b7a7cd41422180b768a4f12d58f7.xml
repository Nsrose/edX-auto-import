      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p><b>Abstraction:</b> This is the main idea of functions. For example, let's say we want to make 3 squares of size 4, 5, and 6. If we didn't use a fucntion with an input "size square", then we would have to repeat the same code 3 times with different inputs.</p>
      <p><b>Composing Functions Together:</b> We can create bigger more signitificant programs by combining functions.</p>
      <p><b>Parallelization:</b> As Dan mentioned in his slides, with functions we can write software that runs on miltiple sysems a the same time.</p>
