      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Any one of these could be the determining factor! Simplest -- when the code might be used as a tutorial. Easiest to implement -- when speed of authoring is most critical. Takes less time -- when runtime performance is most important (e.g., the code has to perform well in real-time, or will be called millions of times as a helper function). Uses up less space -- when space is limited, say on mobile or embedded devices.
