      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>One of the key big ideas here is that recursion is no more powerful than iteration -- that is, anything that could be written recursively could be iteratively (and vice-versa). That said, we've found that thinking functionally, in which there is no state and mutation and you use recursive solutions, is often easier than iterative solutions. Certainly it depends on the problem, but students should certainly add recursion to their arsenal so that they are ready to use it when the problem calls for it.</p>
