      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>If you have enough lead time, and enough space, you initialize a huge list (as big as the biggest possible student ID number) with 0, or 𝚏𝚊𝚕𝚜𝚎. Then, go through all the students in N, and write 1, or 𝚝𝚛𝚞𝚎 in the slot indexed by their student ID. Then, when you're given a particular student S, you look up in the list under their student ID index (constant time), and return the value in that slot.</p>
