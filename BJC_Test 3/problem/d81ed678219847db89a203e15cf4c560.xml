  <p>Let's consider another example using HOF's. Assume we are trying to find the largest odd number in a list of random positive numbers. What are the possible orders we could use HOF's? (Assume that we are soving this problem only using HOF's.):</p>

      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p><b>Keep -&gt; Combine:</b> We could keep all the odd numbers and then combine all the kept numbers with the 'greater than' operator to reduce then to a single maximum number.</p>
      <p><b>Map -&gt; Combine:</b> We could map 0 to all the even numbers in the list, since this list is a list of positivie numbers only and the smallest possible odd number is 1. Then we would reduce the list to a single maximum number using combine with the 'greater than' operator.</p>
      <p><b>Map -&gt; Keep -&gt; Combine:</b> We could map 0 to all the even numbers in the list, since this list is a list of positivie numbers only and the smallest possible odd number is 1. Then we could keep the non-zero numbers. Then we would reduce the list to a single maximum number using combine with the 'greater than' operator.</p>
