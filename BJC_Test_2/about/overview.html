<p> CS10, The Beauty and Joy of Computing, is an exciting new course offered by the UC Berkeley EECS Dept. Computing has changed the world in profound ways. It has opened up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. However, just using a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to program the computer, to translate ideas into code. This course will teach students how to do exactly that, using BYOB and Snap! (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We'll focus on some of the "Big Ideas" of computing, such as abstraction, design, recursion, concurrency, simulations, and the limits of computation. We'll show some beautiful applications of computing that have changed the world, talk about the history of computing, and where it will go in the future. Throughout the course, relevance will be emphasized: relevance to the student and to society. As an example, the final project will be completely of the students' choosing, on a topic most interesting to them. The overarching theme is to expose students to the beauty and joy of computing. This course is designed for computing non-majors, although interested majors are certainly welcome to take the class as well! We are especially excited about bringing computing (through this course) to traditionally under-represented groups in computing, i.e., women and ethnic minorities.</p>

        <a href='http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~ddgarcia/'>Dan Garcia</a> is a Senior Lecturer with Security Of Employment (SOE =
"tenured" teaching faculty) in the Computer Science Division of the
EECS Department at the University of California, Berkeley, and joined
the faculty in the fall of 2000. Dan received his PhD and MS in
Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2000 and 1995, and dual BS
degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering from MIT in 1990.
He was chosen as an ACM Distinguished Educator in 2012. On the fun side, he can dance DDR level 7, play the harmonica, juggle
5 balls, score in the low 90s on the links, spin things on his finger
and knows all the words to many old-school raps, stand-up comedy bits
and Monty Python sketches. He also has a collection of several hundred
game and puzzle books, and terribly enjoys sharing good brain teasers
or playing any one of his many exotic board games with students who
drop by during open office hours. Don't get him started telling jokes...
