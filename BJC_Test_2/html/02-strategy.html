But keep the goal in mind. We're not, right now, dealing with the user interface part of the game: displaying the board, accepting a move from the user, or even noticing when someone wins. Those parts will be easy to add once you've done the hard part, which is figuring out the computer's strategy.</p> <h3>How do <em>you </em>play tic-tac-toe? </h3> <p>Almost certainly, you have a bunch of rules of the form &quot;<strong>if</strong> such-and-such is true, <strong>then</strong> play here.&quot; These rules have different degrees of urgency. For example, the most important rule is &quot;if I can win on this move, then play in the winning square.&quot;</p> <p>Before you read further, answer these questions, discussing them with your partner and with other students if necessary:</p> <blockquote> <p>1. What's the next most important rule?</p> <p>2. Can you express &quot;If I can win on this move&quot; in more detail, in terms of the current board position, so that you could program it into Snap!?</p> </blockquote> <p>The if-all-else-fails rule is &quot;If no other rule applies, play in the best possible square: the center (square 5), if it's free, or a corner (squares 1, 3, 7, and 9) as second choice, or an edge (2, 4, 6, 8) as last resort.&quot;</p> <blockquote> <p>3. Why is the center the best choice? Why is a corner second best? You should have a really short, logical, convincing explanation. Compare your explanation with those of other students.</p> </blockquote> <p>These three rules (including the one you answered in question 1 above) are part of everyone's tic-tac-toe strategy, and they are the minimum acceptable strategy for this assignment.  Humans don't always think alike about the in-between rules; we'll make suggestions later, after you finish the minimal assignment.</p> </body> </html>
