<h2>Logarithmic-Time Algorithm - O(log n)</h2>
<p>A logarithmic-time algorithm is one that requires a number of 
steps proportional to the log(n).  In most cases, we use 2 as 
the base of the log, but it doesn't matter which base because 
we ignore constants.  Because we use the base 2, we can 
rephrase this in the following way: <i>everytime the size of the 
input doubles, our algorithm performs one more 
  step.  </i> &nbsp;
  <br>
  <br>Here are some examples:
 <ul>
<li>Binary search</li>
<li>Searching a tree data structure (we'll see what this is later)</li>
  </ul>
