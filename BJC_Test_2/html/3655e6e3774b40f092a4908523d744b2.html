<h1>A (Non-Video) Game</h1>
<p>Let's play a number-guessing game (you have already seen the Scratch version in lab 3</p>
<p>Between your partner and yourself, decide who will be person G, the guesser: the other person (person P, for picker) picks a number between 1 and 50. Person G asks person P questions to determine the chosen number; the only answers that person P can give are "yes" or "no". The guesser should try two different strategies to playing this game:</p>
<ol>
<li>Guessing in sequence: "Is the number 1?", "Is the number 2?", "Is the number 3?", and so on.</li>
<li>Guessing halfway: You know the number must be between 1 and 50, so you start off by asking "Is the number greater than 25?". If the answer is "yes", you instantly know that it must be between 26 and 100, so you ask "Is the number greater than 50?"; otherwise, the number must be between 1 and 25, so you ask "Is the number greater than 12?" Keep asking questions involving the halfway point.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Play several (around 3) games: person P should pick a wide variety of numbers, while person G should use each strategy alternately. As you play each game, think about which strategy involves fewer questions. Which strategy would be better if, say, the guessing game involved numbers from 1 to 1000? From 1 to a million? Discuss why one strategy better than the other?</p>
