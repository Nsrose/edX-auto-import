<h1>Binary Numbers</h1>

<p>So far, all our examples of recursion have been

<em>command </em>blocks, whose scripts have a structure like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/rec-command.png" alt="recursive command pattern" /></p>

<p>There can be any number of recursive calls interspersed with other commands in the script.</p>

<p>Reporters are slightly trickier, because a reporter can only report <em>one </em>value. So you can't do this:</p>

<p><img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/bad-rec-reporter.png" alt="bad (multi-report) recursive reporter pattern" /></p>

<p>(In fact, Snap<em>!</em> won't let you stack <code>report</code> blocks; since <code>report</code> ends the script, there is no connection tab below the block and you can't put anything directly below it. Optional exercise for hotshots: How did we make that picture?)</p>

<p>Instead, most of the time a recursive reporter call will be inside a <em>combiner</em> that attaches the result of the recursive call to some other value:</p>

<p><img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/rec-reporter.png" alt="correct recursive reporter pattern with combiner" /></p>

<p>The combiner can be an arithmetic operator such as <code>+</code> or <code>&times;</code>:</p>

<p><img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/factorial.png" alt="factorial" /></p>

<p>or a text string operator such as <code>join</code> or <code>join words</code>:</p>

<p><img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/list-to-sentence.png" alt="list-&gt;sentence" /></p>

<p>or a list operator such as <code>append</code> or <code>in front of</code>:</p>

<p><img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/plurals.png" alt="plurals" /></p>

<p>Note: On rare occasions, the recursive call <em>does </em>appear directly inside the <code>report</code>:</p>

<p><img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/piglatin.png" alt="piglatin" /></p>

<p>But almost always, you won't go wrong if you start by thinking about what combining block to use.</p>

<h3>Binary numbers</h3>

<p>If there's one thing everyone knows about computers, it's that they think in zeros and ones. As you know by now, the whole point of computer science is <em>abstraction, </em>so that you can program and use computers without ever having to deal with their low-level circuitry. Still, for some reason the people who made up the AP curriculum standards think you should know about binary numbers.</p>

<p>As you know, in plain old decimal numbers, each digit <em>position </em>represents a power of 10, starting with 1 (which is 10<sup>0</sup>)

  on the right, and multiplying by 10 as you move left.  So, for example, 9827 is, from right to left,</p>

<p align="center">7 &times;  10<sup>0</sup> + 2 &times;  10<sup>1</sup> + 8 &times;  10<sup>2</sup> + 9 &times;  10<sup>3</sup></p>

<p align="left">Binary uses the same positional idea, but with powers of two instead of powers of ten.</p>

<p align="left">Our goal is to write a reporter <code>decimal-&gt;binary</code> that takes a (decimal) number as input, and reports a string of zeros and ones that represent the same number in binary:</p>

<p align="left"><img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/9827.png" alt="decimal-&gt;binary of 9827" /></p>

<p align="left">To solve this problem, you're going to have to know how to do integer division the way you did it in third grade, before you knew about fractions: 17 ÷ 5 = <strong>3 remainder 2</strong>. Here's how to do that in Snap<em>!</em>:</p>

<p align="left"><img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/quotient.png" alt="quotient" /><img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/mod.png" alt="mod" /></p>

<p align="left">In the Operators palette there's a block <code>sqrt of</code> in which the word <code>sqrt</code> is part of a menu of mathematical operations. From that menu, choose <code>floor</code> to get the integer part of the quotient. (It's called &quot;floor&quot; because it's the nearest integer <em>smaller than </em>its input, as opposed to <code>round</code>, which finds the nearest integer whether smaller or larger.) &quot;Mod&quot; is short for <em>modulo, </em>which is the fancy mathematical name for remainder.</p>
