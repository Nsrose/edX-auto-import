        In the code sample below, we have implemented a simple number-guessing game.  The computer chooses a random number and then asks the player to guess the random number.  

        The code is available in <a class="run" href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:http://bjc.eecs.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/prog/conditionals/guess-number.xml">this file</a>.

        The game is not that cool yet, though.  In the next few steps, we are going to make the game much more like playing the number-guessing game with a person!
