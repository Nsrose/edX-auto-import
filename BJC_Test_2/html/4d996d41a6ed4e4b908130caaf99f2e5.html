<h1>Overview</h1>
<h2>Big Ideas</h2>
<ul><li> Explore the basics memory and network capabilities needed for concurrency</li><li> Explore the kinds of problems that need to be solved with concurrency as well as the challenges faced.</li><li> Understand the connection of MapReduce(higher-order function!) to concurrency applications.</li><li> Understand what cloud computing means and what it is providing in terms of services to computing industry</li></ul>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<ul><li> Digital devices, systems, and the networks that interconnect them enable and foster computational approaches to solving problems. (this is from AP's big ideas section VI)</li><li> MapReduce is a particularly nice example of a distributed computing pattern, and the facility to write (and debug, and test, and evaluate) programs in our simplified MapReduce abstraction.</li></ul>
