<h1>The Max Block</h1>

<p>We will now make a different kind of block -- a <em>reporter</em>. To demonstrate this, you will make a block called <tt>max</tt>  that takes two numbers as input and reports the bigger value (the maximum).<br>

			<li>
				Click <tt>Make a block</tt> and select the <tt>Operators</tt> palette. We want a reporter block. This will give the block its round shape as shown above. As the name implies, reporter blocks can report a value. In the image below, you can see that we used names starting with the <tt>%</tt> character as a shortcut for making input variables.
				 Note: Usually, we want you to use meaningful variable names, so that your code will be self-documenting. But in this case, the inputs are two arbitrary numbers that don't have any special meaning inside the <code>max</code> block, so it's okay to use <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.<br>

			<li>
			This should give you a blank <tt>Block editor</tt>. Notice that this time the script below the hat block already has a block in it, the <code>report</code> block from the Control palette. In order for your reporter block to report a value, you put that value (or an expression that produces the value) in the input slot of a <code>report</code> block. Note also that there is no tab at the bottom of the report block; when this block is run, it ends the script. There can be more than one report block in a script, as you'll see shortly, but only one of them can be run each time through the script.<br><br>

		  </li>
			<li>You want to report one of the two input values, either <code>x</code> or <code>y</code>, depending on which is bigger. (If they have the same value, it doesn't matter which you report!) Use an <tt>if/else</tt> block to achieve this:<br><br><img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/prog/maxscript.png" alt="script for max block"></li>
			<li>Now click OK and try out yout block.</li>
		</ol>		
<p>Note: Be sure to test both cases of the <tt>if/else</tt> block. Also, note the <code>Apply</code> button at the bottom; this defines your custom block, like OK, but leaves the editor window open. It's really useful for debugging.</p>
