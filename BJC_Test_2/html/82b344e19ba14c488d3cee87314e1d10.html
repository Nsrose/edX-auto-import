<h1>Recursion in real life </h1>

<p> Recursion is an important skill that programmers develop over countless interations and lots of practice. While it provides for a more sophisticated way to build and write programs, recursion is a phenomenon that is woven into the fabric of our natural and digitized lives. 
<h2> Something fun to start...</h2>
<p> Google <code>recursion</code>. Or click this:

  <br>That was fun, huh?!
  
  <h2>Inception</h2>
  <p> In 2010, the movie Inception hit the box offices and really jostled all of our brains! Each layer upon layer was constructed with the upmost detail and used concepts of recursion in the framework. Beware, spoilers ahead! <a href="http://repeatgeek.com/technical/how-to-view-inception-through-code/"> Recursion in Inception</a>

  <p> <h2>Check out this example of recursion infront of you</h2>
  
  Say you are sitting in a big lecture hall or a large football stadium. You want to find out what row you are in. </p>
 <p>
   You can ask the person in front of you. This repeats till the guy in the front. Then undoes the recursion and goes back (adding 1 and passing it back). By the time the number gets back to you, you'll find out what row you are in.
