<h2>Constant-Time Algorithms - O(1)</h2>
<p>A constant-time algorithm is one that takes the same amount of time, regardless of its input. &nbsp;
  <br>
  <br>Here are some examples:
  <ul>
 
<li>Given two numbers; report the sum</li>
<li>Given a list; report the first element</li>
  <li>Given a list of numbers; report the result of adding the first element to itself 1,000,000 times </li>
  </ul>
  <br><h4>Consider this:</h4> Why is the last example still constant time?
