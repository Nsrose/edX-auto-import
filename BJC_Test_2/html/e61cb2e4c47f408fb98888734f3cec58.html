<h1>Composition of Functions</h1>
<p>Our custom-made blocks are blocks like any other, and we can use them in other block definitions. To demonstrate this, we are going to make a block that computes the maximum of three values. </p>

<p>
  Repeat the steps from the last tutorial to make this version of the max block also take only numbers. Then, in the script for the block, use two copies of the two-input max block: </p>

<h2> Turn It In</h2>
  <p> Your challenge is to make the following two blocks work:</p>
  <ol>
			<li>
				A three-input addition operator that accepts only numbers.
				  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">

					<br>
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				A block named "sum of two smallest" that takes three numbers as inputs, and reports the sum of the two smallest:
				  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">

				</div>
			</li>
