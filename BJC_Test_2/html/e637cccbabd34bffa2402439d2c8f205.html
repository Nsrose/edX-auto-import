</ul>

<h2> Activities </h2>
<ul>
    <li>
         Discover how to create different shaped blocks, create inputs of different types, and create inputs with initial values.
    </li>
    <li>
         Employ blocks and data abstraction to break problems down into smaller problems and thus write more beautiful and elegant code.
    </li>
