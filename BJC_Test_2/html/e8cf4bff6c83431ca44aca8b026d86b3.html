<h1>Simplifying a Tic Tac Toe Board Drawer Using Custom Blocks</h1>
<p>In a previous lab, we used a repeat block to avoid duplicating code. Similarly, we can use a custom block to avoid duplicating code. Below is some code to draw a tic-tac-toe board. Your goal is to create blocks that make this code simpler. </p>

<p>Some things to remember:</p>
<ul>
            <li>As a first step, break up this
                drawing task into meaningful sub-tasks.  We suggest doing this 
                working with pen and paper, not while looking at the code!
                </li>
            <li>
                Give your new blocks
                appropriate names.  You want to make it easy to read the
                code—at its best, like natural, english sentences—
                and understand what it does.    
            </li>
            <li>
                It may make sense to "split" some blocks up into different
                custom blocks.  For instance, a single
              <img class="inline" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-left-180.png" alt="turn left 180 degrees">
                might be better performed as a
              <img class="inline" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-left-90.png" alt="turn left 90 degrees">
                in one custom block followed by a
              <img class="inline" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-left-90.png" alt="turn left 90 degrees">
                in another.

            </li>
        </ul>
