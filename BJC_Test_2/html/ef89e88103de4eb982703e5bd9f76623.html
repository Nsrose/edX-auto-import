<p>Often, we will want to move the character with the arrow keys (i.e. up, down, left, and right). We can use the block point in direction as shown below.</p>

<p> In the next step, you're going to want two sprites with costumes; you could start with the earlier project making a snap play.
<br>
There are still a few things in the Snap! user interface that you probably have not used yet. Experiment with the rotation controls shown below and make sure you understand the behavior of each. (Hint: it'll be more obvious if your sprite isn't pointing toward the right, and isn't wearing its turtle (arrow) costume.) These will probably come in handy at some point!

    Finally, make a character move around based upon the keys that you have pressed. You will need to use one of the rounded hat pieces, such as the one in the example shown below. These can respond to key presses and start a script. Use the four arrow keys to control the sprite motion. </p>
