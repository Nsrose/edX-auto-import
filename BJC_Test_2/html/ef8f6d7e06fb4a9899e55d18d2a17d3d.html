<h1>Pre-Processing the GPS Data</h1>

    In subsequent steps of this lab, we will ask you to visualize and
    work with the data in SNAP. There is no standard solution to
    do this: It's different for every data set. With this data, we recommend
    to perform two steps of what's typically
    called <i>pre-processing</i>:
<br>
<ol>
      <li>Remove redundant values, i.e. get rid of information that
        doesn't make any difference.</li>
      <li>Center the coordinates so they can be visualized in an x/y-coordinate 
        system. Data can be easily centered by subtracting
        the mean of the data from all data points. <br>
      </li>
    </ol>

<br>
    Here is an example:

    The values 123102, 123103, 123104 are only differ in the last digits, so they can be reduced to: 2, 3, 4. For visualization, we can center them by removing the mean (which is 3). The result is: -1, 0, 1.

    While you could do this in SNAP, using a text editor and a simple
    calculator is probably an easier choice. So before you move on to
    the next step, generate a text file that contains the interesting
    part of the coordinates, centered, line-by-line.
