Fortunately for us, the meaning is far easier to understand than you would first think -- an algorithm is simply a set of steps that allow us to solve a particular problem.  In fact, many other careers use algorithms, but have different names for them. <br> <ul> <li> <strong>Cooks</strong> use or memorize <em>recipes</em> to prepare food. </li> <li> <strong>UPS Truck Drivers</strong> have &quot;340 Methods,&quot; the UPS handbook for drivers, that describes 340 different <em>protocols</em> that should be followed and how long each one should take. </li> <li> <strong>Electricians</strong> follow the same general <em>steps</em> when replacing or adding cabling at different houses. </li> <li> <strong>Salesman</strong> often have <em>scripts</em> to follow when making a sales call.  The scripts describe how to open the conversation (and possibly more) in order to increase the odds of gaining a client. </li> <li> <strong>Subway Sandwich Artists</strong> have a <em>series of signs</em> stuck to the inside of the counter that prompt the employees with what should be said. </li> <li> <strong>Do-It-Yourself projects</strong> all come with some sort of <em>instructions</em>. <em>Directions</em>, such as those for assembling a piece of furniture or a Lego kit, are algorithms. </li> </ul> Computer science <em>algorithms</em> are conceptual solutions to a problem (such as sorting a list), whereas the <em>implementation</em> of an algorithm is the actual code that brings the solution to life.  The implementations themselves can typically be written in almost any programming language and run on any computer; the concepts behind the algorithm are not affected by these types of conditions, in the same way that the outcome of a well-written recipe should (hopefully) not be affected by the cook or kitchen. </body> </html>
