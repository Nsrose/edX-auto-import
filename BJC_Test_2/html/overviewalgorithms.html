<h1>Overview</h1>
<h2>Big Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Explore how to analyze algorithmic speed and understand various factors that contribute to slow or fast runtimes.</li>
<li>Explore the implications of a world increasingly controlled by algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Activites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Solidify understanding of what an algorithm is and why they're important to computer science and other fields.</li>
<li>Gain a basic understanding of why certain algorithms perform better than others.</li>
<li>There's often more than one way to solve the same problem. Certain solutions will be superior to others, but very often choosing a solution will require evaluating a list of trade-offs relevant to your particular situation.</li>
<li>Practice implementing algorithms that were discussed verbally.</li>
<li>Memoization is a technique that can be used for improving the performance of algorithms with repeated calculations at the expense of a higher memory requirement.</li>
<li>Hiding algorithmic details behind a layer of abstraction makes it easier to upgrade or adjust your implementation in the future.</li>
</ul>
