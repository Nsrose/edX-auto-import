<h1>Overview</h1>
<h2>Big Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Explore the basics - memory and network capabilities needed for concurrency.</li>
<li>Explore the kind of problems that need to be solved with concurrency as well as the challenges faced.</li>
<li>Understand the connection of MapReduce(higher-order function!) to concurrency applications.</li>
<li>Understand what cloud computing means and what it is providing in terms of services to computing industry.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Activites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Digital devices, systems, and the networks that interconnect them enable and foster computational approaches to solving problems. (This is from AP's big ideas Section VI.)</li>
<li>MapReduce is a particularly nice example of a distributed computing pattern, and the facility to write (and debug, and test, and evaluate) programs in our simplified MapReduce abstraction.</li>
</ul>
