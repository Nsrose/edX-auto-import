<h1>Overview</h1>
<h2>Big Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are more to HOFs than just map, keep, and combine.</li>
<li>Functions can be treated as data, just like strings, numbers, and lists.</li>
<li>Creating our own higher-order function blocks allows us to achieve a whole new level of generality in our programs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Activites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Build non-HOF blocks to use as helper functions in larger HOFs problems.</li>
<li>Complete complex, multi-step HOFs problems.</li>
<li>Use HOFs to solve real-life problems, like minimizing or composing functions.</li>
</ul>
