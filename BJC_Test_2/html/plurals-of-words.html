The <code>in front of</code> block probably looks strange when you first see it, with its asymmetrical inputs (one item, one list), but it's exactly the combiner we need to put the plural of the first word and the plurals of the rest of the words back together.</p> <hr /> <p>Do the following exercises using recursion, not HOFs.</p> <p>☞ Make a <code>squares</code> block that takes a list of numbers as input, and reports a list of the squares of the numbers.</p> <p><img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/squares-ex.png" alt="squares example" /></p> <p>☞ Make an <code>exaggerate</code> block that takes a sentence as input, and reports a sentence in which every number in the input is doubled, &quot;good&quot; is replaced by &quot;great,&quot; &quot;bad&quot; is replaced by &quot;terrible,&quot; &quot;like&quot; is replaced by &quot;love,&quot; and &quot;dislike&quot; is replaced by &quot;hate.&quot; Hint: You'll almost certainly find the <code>all but first word of ()</code> and <code>first word of ()</code> blocks useful. You can find these in the "Words, sentences" library (click the "file" icon, select "Libraries..."). Another hint: You'll probably want a helper function that exaggerates a single word.</p> <p><img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/ex-ex.png" alt="exaggerate example" /></p> </body> </html>
