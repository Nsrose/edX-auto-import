Here is how it could happen (for this example order, all 6 permutations are possible = {123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321}): <ul> <li>finish starts empty</li> <li>1 reads finish (), joins its 1, finish is now 1.</li> <li>2 reads finish (1), joins its 2, finish is now 12.</li> <li>3 reads finish (12), joins its 3, finish is now 123.</li> <li>finish is 123</li> </ul> </li> <li>If only two numbers were present, we had a race condition, and here is how it could happen (again, all 6 combinations and permutations are possible = {12, 21, 13, 31, 23, 32}): <ul> <li>finish starts empty</li> <li>3 reads finish () into its hold</li> <li>1 reads finish () into its hold</li> <li>3 joins its 3 to the number it held (), finish is now 3</li> <li>1 joins its 1 to the number it held () and sets finish to 1. The 3 is now lost, <em>clobbered</em> due to a race condition.</li> <li>2 reads finish (1), joins its 2, finish is now 12.</li> <li>finish is 12</li> </ul> </li> <li>If only one number were present, we also had a race condition, and here is how it could happen (again, all permutations possible = {1, 2, 3}): <ul> <li>finish starts empty</li> <li>1 reads finish () into its hold</li> <li>2 reads finish () into its hold</li> <li>3 reads finish () into its hold</li> <li>3 joins its 3, finish is now 3</li> <li>2 joins its 2 to the number it held () and sets finish to 2. The 3 is now lost, <em>clobbered</em> due to a race condition.</li> <li>1 joins its 1 to the number it held () and sets finish to 1. The 2 is now lost, <em>clobbered</em> due to a race condition.</li> <li>finish is 1</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </body></html>
