Latency is influenced by hardware i.e. which connection device is used (e.g., wireless connections take longer than wired) and also other factors such as the length of the route or latency bottlenecks in the route. Latencies are easiest measured with the Linux tool <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_%28networking_utility%29">ping</a>. Ping takes a hostname or IP address as a parameter and sends a small test packet to the node that is echoed by it. Once the echo is received time is measured. If the host does not send an echo back in a reasonable time, a timeout is signaled indicating the host is offline. This is repeated until the user presses CTRL+C. <br> <br> Under Linux ping is sometimes accessible as <code>/usr/sbin/ping</code> and on Mac it's sometimes <code>/sbin/ping</code>.<br> <br> Go ahead and try:<br> <br> <code>ping www.berkeley.edu<br> ping www.google.com<br> ping australia.gov.au </code><br> &nbsp;<br> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Ping can also be used on entire networks. This is called broadcast ping, whereby all online hosts on the Ethernet bus will respond. In order to ping your network you need to find out the IP address of your own host and derive the network IP. There are several ways to determine your own IP but the easiest is way (when you are not behind a router) is to open your browser to <span style="font-style: italic;">www.google.com</span> and search for "my IP".&nbsp; Then replace the last digits of the IP (say XXX.YYY.ZZZ.001) address with 255. So if your IP address is 192.150.186.72, your replacement would be 192.150.186.255. <br> <br> Then you execute:<br> <br> <code>ping -b</code> XXX.YYY.ZZZ.255 <br> <br> Go ahead and try it! <br> <br> Note that this may not always work as some networks forbid the broadcast ping or are configured differently. Nevertheless, for a system administrator it's an easy way to test all the hosts along the bus at once. <br> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">&nbsp;<br> </span> <h3><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>Throughput<br> </h3> Throughput is much harder to measure. It also massively depends on what other processes in your computer take bandwidth as well as what other computer on the Ethernet use the bus. A simple way but not necessarily very accurate way to measure bandwidth is provided by the website <a href="http://www.speedtest.net">http://www.speedtest.net</a>. Give it a quick try and answer the following questions:<br> <ol> <li>Run the speed test three times. How much did the throughput vary?</li> <li>Is upload speed different than download speed? If so, why?</li> <li>Synchronize with your peers and measure the speed concurrenlty. How much did it drop?</li> </ol> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </body> </html>
