      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Just like the number guessing game (I think of a number from 1-100, and you have 7 guesses to guess a number and I'll tell you whether you were too low, too high, or you got it), you can divide and conquer -- start at the middle, and cut the problem in half with every wrong guess. This yields a logarithmic running time. As an aside, log2(100)=6.64..., which is why you can always win the 1-100 guessing game in 7 guesses, and (if I'm allowed to move my number around), can NEVER win the 1-100 guessing game in 6 guesses.</p>
