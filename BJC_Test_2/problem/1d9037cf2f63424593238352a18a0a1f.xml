      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p> Many challenges still face AI research and one of the biggest is attempting to duplicate human intuition. The problems facing AI research are broken down into about ten sub-problems. These are: </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>1) Deduction, reasoning, problem solving - of which human intuition is chief </p>
      <p>2) Knowledge representation - this is where knowledge engineering plays a large role </p>
      <p>3) Planning - being able to make its own plans to accomplish goals without being told </p>
      <p>4) Learning - this problem has existed from the beginning </p>
      <p>5) Natural language processing - Watson made huge strides in this area </p>
      <p>6) Motion and manipulation - robots and AI are closely linked </p>
      <p>7) Perception - includes but is not limited to speech recognition, facial recognition and object recognition </p>
      <p>8) Social intelligence - much of human communication is nonverbal and this encompasses that </p>
      <p>9) Creativity - during Kasparov's 1997 match he attributed a certain move to highly developed intelligence that a programmer later discovered was probably just a random glitch </p>
      <p>10) General intelligence - also known as strong AI.</p>
