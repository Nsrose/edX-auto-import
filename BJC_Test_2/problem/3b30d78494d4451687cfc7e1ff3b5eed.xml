      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p><b>Finding an item in a list:</b>The algorithm complexity of this is given by some polynomial of N, where N is the length of the list. Specifically, this algorithm goes through each element of a given list once and compares the item we are looking for with each element. Then it has a runtime of O(N).</p>
      <p><b>Deleting items from a list:</b>The algorithm complexity of this is given by some polynomial of N, where N is the length of the list. Specifically, the runtime of this is constant O(1). And so in terms of N we would have a polynomial f(N) = 1*(N^0)</p>
      <p><b>Finding a fibonnacci number:</b>The algorithm complexity of this is given by O(2^N). Since 2^N is not a polynomial, this algorithm is not inlcuded in the 'P' category.</p>
