      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Depending on the task, computing a function serially could be faster and easier than in parallel. For example, assume we are trying to bake a cake. It would make sense to mix preheat the oven, mix the ingredients and then bake. You can see how this could go wrong if these steps happened all at once.</p>
