      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>For the first three examples, the lighting of a classroom is important for the corresponding individuals; the student needs good lighting to study, the Professor needs good lighting to interact with he students and ensure the lecture's success, the building manager needs to make sure that the lighting in the entire building is of good quality. However, the coach would probably be more interested for the lighting on the football field rather than in the classroom. </p>
