      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p><b>Functional Programming:</b> From the name we can assume fast that it focuses on functions. Also, in fucntional programming we are interested in what information is needed to and transformations are required/</p>
      <p><b>
    Programming:</b> Also uses functions and mostly loops and conditionals, like 'if' or 'else'. In imperitive programming we are interested in how to perform tasks and in tracking state changes.</p>
