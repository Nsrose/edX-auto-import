<section><article><h2>April 14, 2014</h2>Welcome to edX!
<p>
  <br>
  As part of an effort to make CS10 available to the entire world, we are moving CS10 onto edX to test new functionalities. You are now officially a beta tester!
</p>
<br>
<p>
  
Navigate through the course using the menu bar to your left. Have access to all your resources in one location with the options at the top. We hope you will enjoy having everything in one window. No more tabbing between the home page, labs, and Snap! in your  browser!
</p>
<br>
<p>
  
A survey will be sent out in which we'd love to hear your thoughts about this new platform. In the meantime, if you have any questions, talk to your TA or shoot the edX team an email at bjcbb@lists.berkeley.edu.

Thanks for trying out edX. We hope you enjoy the new interface! </article></section>
